                        <h3>If I request for a replacement, when will I get it?</h3>

                        <p>Visit My Orders to check the status of your replacement.

                            In most locations, the replacement item is delivered to you at the time of pick-up.
                            In all other areas, the replacement is initiated after the originally delivered item is
                            picked up.
                            Please check the SMS & email we send you for your replacement request for more details.</p>

                        <h3>Can items be returned after the time period mentioned in the seller's Returns Policy?</h3>

                        <p>No, sellers will not be able to accept returns after the time period mentioned in the
                            seller's Returns Policy.</p>
                        <h3>Do I have to return the freebie when I return a product?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, the freebie has to be returned along with the product.</p>

                        <h3>How do returns work?</h3>
                        <p>You can raise a request to return your items with these simple steps:</p>
                        <p>1. Write a Mail to krishilimitedindia@gmail.com</p>
                        <!-- <p>2. Go to My Orders</p>
                        <p>3. Click on 'Return' against the item you wish to return or exchange</p> -->
                        <p>2. Fill in the details and mention the reason of returning the Product(mandatory) and raise a
                            return request</p>

                        <p>Once you raise a request, you'll get an email and SMS confirming that your request is being
                            processed.
                            Based on the item, your request may be automatically approved or you may be contacted for
                            more details.
                            If the request is approved, you should mail your product to: C/O DASRATH PAUL, OM NAGAR
                            COLONY ARATEE NO. 86/320, SARNATH VARANASI Varanasi UP 221007 IN. You should consider using
                            a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance
                        </p>

                        <p>Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a
                            nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. Please check your order summary
                            to understand the delivery charges for individual products.</p>

                        <p>For Products listed at SHYAMAVSVSS KRISHI LIMITED. Plus, a Rs 40 charge for delivery per item
                            may be applied if the order value is less than Rs 500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are
                            delivered free.</p>

                        <p>Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline of X-Y business days?

                        <p>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between the day your
                            placed your order and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the
                            product page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and
                            Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates.
                        <p>

                        <h2>What is the estimated delivery time?</h2>

                        <p>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page.
                            Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays.</p>

                        <h2>Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:</h2>

                        <p>The Seller offering the product
                            Product's availability with the Seller
                            The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller.</p>
                        <p>Are there any hidden costs (sales tax, octroi etc) on items sold by Sellers on SHYAMAVSVSS
                            KRISHI LIMITED?</p>

                        <p>There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on SHYAMAVSVSS KRISHI LIMITED List
                            prices are final and all-inclusive.
                            The price you see on the product page is exactly what you would pay.</p>

                        <p>Delivery charges are not hidden charges and are charged (if at all) extra depending on the
                            Seller's shipping policy.</p>

                        <p>Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller?</p>

                        <p>You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery
                            times for sellers of the product you are interested in. Delivery times are influenced by
                            product availability, geographic location of the Seller, your shipping destination and the
                            courier
                            partner's time-to-deliver in your location.</p>

                        <p>Please enter your default pin code on the product page
                            (you don't have to enter it every single time) to know more accurate delivery times on the
                            product page itself.</p>

                        <p>Seller does not/cannot ship to my area. Why?</p>

                        <p>Please enter your pincode on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single time)
                            to know whether the
                            product can be delivered to your location.</p>

                        <p>If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout stage,
                            the pincode in your shipping address will be used to check for serviceability.</p>

                        <p>Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on

                            Whether the Seller ships to your location
                            Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular products to your location
                            The availability of reliable courier partners in your location
                            At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is entirely at their
                            discretion.</p>

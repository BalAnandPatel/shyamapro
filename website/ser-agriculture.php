                                            Contract farming is an arrangement where the production and supply of agriculture products are done under a contract between farmers, suppliers and producers. This arrangement can act as a catalyst for modernizing agricultural practices in India because the industries dependent on agriculture products requires adequate and timely inputs for optimum agricultural produce. In addition, the National Agricultural Policy of the Indian Government is also promoting private participation to meet the increasing need.

                                                Vegetable farming is the growing of vegetables for human consumption. The practice probably started in several parts of the world over ten thousand years ago, with families growing vegetables for their own consumption or to trade locally. At first manual labour was used but in time livestock were domesticated and the ground could be turned by the plough. More recently, mechanisation has revolutionised vegetable farming with nearly all processes being able to be performed by machine. Specialist producers grow the particular crops that do well in their locality. New methods—such as aquaponics, raised beds and cultivation under glass—are used. Marketing can be done locally in farmer's markets, traditional markets or pick-your-own operations, or farmers can contract their whole crops to wholesalers, canners or retailer.
